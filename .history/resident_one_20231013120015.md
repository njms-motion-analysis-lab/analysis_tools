Elaine
Alright, OK. Hi. My name is Elaine. I'm a second year medical student. I'm working with Doctor Chu, and the goal of our project is to examine how the work and training environment and other intersectional factors influence healthcare and patient safety, particularly particularly for female. Patients receiving surgery. I'll be asking you some questions and we would like you to please share your honest thoughts. The audio will be recorded and it will remain anonymous and will be securely saved and deleted after transcribing. And this interview will be about an hour. And please feel free to stop me at anytime. If you don't feel comfortable proceeding.
Female resident 1
No problem. Thank you. So. Much Elaine, thank you.
Elaine
All right, so my first question is, how would you describe your work setting?
Female resident 1
I would describe it like an athletic team. I think there are moments of pressure and there are moments of elation and camaraderie.
Elaine
OK. And how would you describe your gender?
Female resident 1
A female.
Elaine
And do you work alone with other or with others?
Female resident 1
With others frequently.
Elaine
And do you work in one team with the same people or do you work in multiple teams with different people?
Female resident 1
Multiple teams (with different people).
Elaine
OK. And how would you describe the genders of your coworkers?
Female resident 1
Depending on the team member, for instance, if I'm working with. Other surgeons, they are predominantly more male. However, if I'm working on more of an interdisciplinary team, for instance, nursing physical therapy and or social work, I would say that it swings the other direction and is predominantly more female.
Elaine
OK. Thank you for describing that. Have you noticed any differences in how these teams function between your surgery team and your interdisciplinary teams?
Female resident 1
Sure. So I think it's a little bit challenging to answer that, because when you're working with other surgeons, being your resident colleagues, you're at the same hierarchy level or below, shall we say, because I'm an intern. So those people would be above me frequently, that I'm working with. While when you're working with interdisciplinary teams, you may be higher up in the food chain than others. So it is a little bit of a different dynamic and somewhat of an apples and oranges comparison. Listen, you know when I'm working alongside my residents, it's generally speaking when we're of similar residency levels, it's very much a discussion, I would say, until you get to the hierarchy where it's, you know, ones versus fives. Then it's a little bit more of you're being told a direction and when you're working in your interdisciplinary team, while there is a dialogue, you're still the decision maker and frequently people are coming to you for a decision. So, it's a little bit less of a team and again, you're more the director.
Elaine
OK. That makes sense and. Does this difference in you being the decision maker or you following the? I guess the orders of your superiors? Does that affect the quality of these teams, how they perform and take care of patients?
Female resident 1
You know, personally, I pride myself on being a very good communicator, so I feel that when I'm working with the interdisciplinary teams and I am the decision maker, I feel as though when I follow up on the task, it is well carried out I frequently document and put notes in after conversations. Or after, say a procedure, I'm not somebody who walks by and says hey, I did that dressing change. I will put a procedure note in that I perform the dressing change and attempt, if not usually, to address all like components taking out components put back in. Describe it so that the next person coming along knows what to expect.
Elaine
OK, I see. And my next question is, can you describe your interactions with coworkers of different genders?
Female resident 1
Yeah, it's hard to generalize you. Know I think people. Do dwell on the one or two positive or one or two negative interactions that we have. I think that when I have interactions with my male colleagues of the same, you know, ranking in residency, it's pretty straightforward. UM. Cut and dry. And you know, if we have to correct each other, we correct each other and move along. I think that when I have interactions with my female counterparts in residency, it's a bit more of a prolonged conversation. It's a discussion, you know, for better or worse. Perhaps it's because we're the same gender, so perhaps it's because, you know, we're friends. I can't necessarily speak to exactly why those conversations may differ or comment  on them.
Elaine
Mm-hmm. OK. So is there a specific gender of your coworkers that you turn to for help in certain situations, and could you describe those differences? Or your thought process when you turn to these people for help.
Female resident 1
Sure. I mean unfortunately, you know, in the orthopedic world, there aren't as many people my gender, so there actually aren't as many people. Thus I'm a bit forced to go to men, when I'm having discussions, I don't know that I've had a conversation that required this, you know for patient care? I haven't really thought about a difference in genders in a discussion. But I will say that. I feel that if I were to ask a basic question like, hey, what's the plan for this patient? I don't know that any of us in residency are the best at giving a thorough plan, meaning they're in this for this long, they're going to follow up on this date. They're going to take these medications. We usually get three out of the four, but there's often something missing. And I can't say that I've identified if it's a man or a woman. Or male or female, who might be more frequently forgetting to complete this the plan basically. So I think I have equal conversations with both.
Elaine
I see. OK. Thank you. And if you feel comfortable at answering this in your work setting, are there, do you feel that there are certain stereotypes regarding any specific gender? And could you elaborate on those?
Female resident 1
Absolutely. I mean, I think for the most part I don't feel it amongst my resident colleagues. I feel it from my attendings. I feel it from patients for sure, and occasionally from other staff members. Most patients assume that the female who enters the room is the new. Worse, and that while it doesn't happen to me as often because of my physical stature, it does happen to me enough and I am clear to make sure that I introduce myself as doctor so as not to be confused and then I don't think I have the same. Joking. Kind of. Casual relationship with some of the nursing staff that some of the male my male colleagues do have and and then I obviously I feel that socially like I'm not as intertwined with my resident counterparts pretty good. But you know there's certainly things that. They may not be comfortable. They have significant others. They don't want to take me to the pool as the one girl. You know, those kind of social interactions are different.
Elaine
OK, I see. So my follow up questions for that, do these stereotypes that you're attendings or patients perceive of you, do you think they affect the quality of patient care that you can provide them?
Female resident 1
I think it depends. If they cannot be overcome because when patients are adamant that you are not the doctor, you cannot provide the patient care that you need to. You're trying to address something. Do addressing change whatever explain or consent someone, and they are insistent that you are not the doctor. It does create a barrier to patient care.
Elaine
Hmm, I see and then my next follow-up question is you mentioned that. You feel less intertwined with your Co residents because there's predominantly male. Is that correct? Do you think this lack? Or less of a connection affects your teamwork.
Female resident 1
Sure. I mean, I think it does. I haven't, I don't experience it as much yet, but you're certainly not there for the casual locker room conversations, which is frequently alluded to the debrief after the case, the let's chat it out kind of thing. You know you're not in the same locker room. Changing after the case you're not, then you're not grabbing a beer afterwards and socially discussed. It you're infrequently invited to sporting events, you know, like those kind of things and. So it does create an interesting dynamic again. Does it affect me that much? It's it's hard to quantify I guess, but I certainly do feel like when people come back and say, hey, we had a great time, you know this weekend or going out or whatever and you know whether it's the boys were at the batting cages. You know that the girls weren't invited to kind of thing can be a little bit off putting.
Elaine
Thank you for sharing. What do you think can be done to prevent this in the future?
Female resident 1
I mean, I don't want to ruin anybodys party it's. You know, everybody deserves to be themselves and you know, I think that the way to. Equalize the playing field and rectify the situation is to have more women involved. So if the guys want to be the guys, I mean, I don't think it's going to be a straight divide, but then it's like you still have a team of allies and you can intertwine a little bit more comfortably and there are more. You know, sort of mixed gender activities that are all inclusive. I think that that's, I guess that would be the best way is not to stop anybody from doing what they do, but instead to encourage more women and promote more women in the field to diversify it. And so there's more.
Elaine
That makes sense. Thank you. So moving on to my next question. Have you worked in a team that is predominantly one gender and in a team that's predominantly, I guess the other gender. Could you describe those differences that you've experienced in each setting and if there are any differences?
Female resident 1
Sure. And this is just healthcare, just work environment, correct? OK. Yeah. So I mean, I think that in rotating off service, I found myself on teams that are predominantly female and it's. Like the male locker room talk, but the female version and it's comfortable collegiate and it a banter. I guess I would say an open dialogue versus more business when it's female. And then I'm on a male team- it's more business, less dialogue, less banter. When I'm a female on a mostly female team, it's more of like I was alluding to locker room kind of. You're just you're chatting in between, you're getting things done, but it's a little bit more of a banter I guess.
Elaine
Mm-hmm. OK. And could you, umm, describe more about the dialogue in the female team? What does this include?
Female resident 1
Yeah, sure. So let's see. Kind of think back to last week when I had a primarily female team. I think we just. It was free flowing as we were reading through notes addressing things. It just came out. Hey, what do you think? What should we do? Is this the plan? It was easy and comfortable.
Elaine
OK. Do you think there were any differences in the performance of these respective teams?
Female resident 1
I think there was a difference in my performance perhaps I think at the end of the day the job still got done, but I think I came away feeling better and feeling like I won the day rather than it being really hard and I had to go over or against the grain at times to get things done. It felt like. We were always moving forward when I was with female colleagues where the dialogue was more open.
Elaine
OK. Thank you. And if you've ever been on a team with different genders in the team, could you describe how the different genders work together and if there are any benefits to having different genders on a team or any disadvantages?
Female resident 1
Yeah, I think like anything else, diversity is important in anything brings different opinions, different perspectives. So I, I do feel that being diverse in gender in any realm is important and benefits the patient and and then. What was the other part of that question that? I haven't answered.
Elaine
See, I think you talked about the benefits. Are there any disadvantages having different genders on a team?
Female resident 1
I think it's a. It's a personal feeling of disadvantage. I don't think that it necessarily harms the work that's done, but I can feel less satisfied when I feel like I wasn't hurt as much. Or that we didn't come to a resolution or it wasn't really clear. Yeah, I think that at the end of the day, I may go home, may not always may go home. Feeling a little bit less satisfied with the. Job that I did.
Elaine
And you said that you didn't feel that there was any differences in how the teams performed or?
Female resident 1
I think at the end of the day the job got done, whether it got done more efficiently or less efficiently, I'm not so sure that's a personal feeling because at the end. Of the day it got done.
Elaine
OK. Thank you. So now I'm going to move on to a different section of questions, talking more about patient care. And so my first question is, do you think the physician treats all patients the same?
Female resident 1
Ah yes, I I don't. I mean, I don't think anybody treats everyone the same regardless of your employment or or gender. I think that there are, you know, you can't just say every ACL gets treated the same we. Don't we try? Athletes different than we treat some weekend. Warriors. Then we treat you know the. Has the the mom who's staying at home. We have different treatment plans for each of these people and so therefore they are treated differently for the same injury.
Elaine
OK. That makes sense. Do you think there's ever a difference in the quality of treatment based on the patient who the patient is?
Female resident 1
I do. I think that some patients are perceived as being very difficult and may receive different treatment than those patients who are perhaps a little bit more easygoing and friendlier.
Elaine
OK. And could you describe those differences between the easygoing and the more difficult patients?
Female resident 1
Sure. At times I've seen that that's more of a dialogue of options versus a patient who and this also is a patient factor when they come in, knowing what they want, whether it's necessarily indicated or not, some providers may deliver because that's the easier thing to do. While not being completely the wrong treatment, it just may not be their normal go to or patterns. So yes, patients receive different treatment plans and different options. Sometimes, based on their understanding and education level, sometimes based on their on their involvement in their care.
Elaine
That makes sense. And if you've ever witnessed A physician treating patients differently, could you describe it?
Female resident 1
Sure. I mean, I work in a hospital that is rather. Underprivileged and so. Certainly there are times when patients may not have a social setting that is supportive of the standard of care, and thus you have to get a little bit more creative in looking out for the best interest of the patient in you know, our eyes as a provider. UM. Given their social situation, whether it be. Substance use or supportive care after surgery. So some patients do potentially. Go down different treatment pathways because of extenuating factors.
Elaine
OK. What do you think could be done to prevent this situation?
Female resident 1
I mean it's it's a tough, it's a tough, multifaceted question. We can't solve all of the world's problems overnight. You know, I think resources, resource availability, increasing resource availability is like the most important thing. But how we do it, I. Have no idea.
Elaine
OK. Thank you. So my next question is if you feel comfortable sharing, have you ever participated in treating patients differently and what factors may? Have led to this.
Female resident 1
Sure, I'm a resident. I'm bound by my higher upsdecision making, so I'm often not often, but occasionally carrying out things that I. May or may not under fully understand first of all, and so a decision that I may not fully understand, I may be acting on and in the moment I may not understand why it is perceived as the best option for a patient frequently given. The social situation of the patient.
Elaine
And so, moving on what intersectional factors do you think affects patient health outcomes?
Female resident 1
I think communication is probably the number one, and because I feel that we often underestimate. Or overestimate. I guess I should say the patient understanding of what's going on and what to expect. I don't think that expectations are often set and which leads to this set this satisfaction and non compliance. And then of course access to resources which is vastly different for everyone. Is a major determinant of how patient outcomes.
Elaine
OK. Thank you. What intersectional factors or characteristics of physicians do you think might affect how patient outcomes are?
Female resident 1
Yeah. So I think again how well they communicate with patients is important how their style of communication. Some patients are not going to respond to threats if you don't do this, then this will happen. Some patients don't respond well to that. They need a little bit more of uh delicate encouragement and some patients need it done for them. You know, this is where you are going on this. State, which is not always possible, but again I think everything goes back to communication and communication style.
Elaine
And so, in your opinion, what is an effective Communication style that provides the best patient outcomes.
Female resident 1
I think clear, concise and thorough, the more you talk, the more people get confused.
Elaine
OK. That makes sense. And do you see any differences in our positions of different genders, practice medicine? And can you describe those differences?
Female resident 1
Yeah. I mean, I think that it's an afterthought frequently with my male colleagues about discharge planning and how patients are going to get home like the surgery's done. Great. Now what's going to happen, they have to go to rehab. They don't have to go to rehab, they have resources. They don't have resources. And if they didn't have that conversation with the patient, then they can't adequately plan for discharge. Now a lot of that happens with social work, but if you're not understanding, then how can you properly order and follow through and encourage the patient to properly recover?
Elaine
And how would you describe how female physicians plan the discharge?
Female resident 1
Yeah. So I mean, again, there aren't that many of us, but I do think that we tend to be a little. Bit more holistic, you know, hey, this is going to affect this. Oh, you have a baby at home. You're not going to pick the baby up for six weeks. You know, you can use the other arm, but not this one. Do you have two baby? You know, do you have a dog? Do you have stairs? How are you going to make you know how you going to do your daily? Activities and think about the stuff that impacts us every single day rather than, oh, you can't go back to work. Oh, you can't, you know, do one or two things. It's sort of the daily brush. Your teeth. That's something you do multiple times a day and can be really difficult if you injure your dominant hand. You know, those types of considerations and acknowledgements.
Elaine
OK. And what do you think can be done to help? Equalize the discharge planning between the physicians of different genders.
Female resident 1
I mean, there's already a mediator with social work that tries to sort of pick up the pieces and add. So I, you know, I think ultimately patients get what they need, whether it's pulling teeth and extra phone calls. I'm not sure social work or the person who ends up with the burden of that labor may be able to speak to that better. But I mean, ultimately, I think everybody gets to the same goal. It's just how easily and how efficiently, perhaps it's achieved.
Elaine
And do you think the gender of the patient influences how effective or how careful a physician plans the discharge?
Female resident 1
I think that men tend to ask fewer questions and they tend to come up later, which then you have to go back a second, third or fourth time and answer the missed questions. And I think women tend to worry a lot about. A lot about the discharge planning and be cautious and perhaps not go home when they could and go to rehab because they are concerned about something bad happening.
Elaine
OK. That makes sense. And so we talked about the discharge planning. Do you see any other differences in how physicians of different genders practice medicine?
Female resident 1
I mean what I see is my female call. I don't can't particularly put my finger on something. I think the majority of people. Are prepared there. Are few people who aren't because of the field that we're in. Those tend, you know, they tend to be men because there aren't that many of us women around, you know, for instance, if you're preparing for a surgical day, there are probably equal number of women and men who will prepare the night before. But then there's also the extra group of men who don't. So it may appear, you know. That men don't plan as much, but there just aren't as many women to kind of, even out the comparative pool.
Elaine
Hmm. I see.  Thank you. And so my next question is how would you describe the genders of your patients? Do you predominantly work with one gender or no?
Female resident 1
No equal. Yeah, equal parts.
Elaine
And have you noticed any differences between your interactions and with patients of different genders and if there are, what are these differences?
Female resident 1
Yeah. I mean, I think it goes back to the credibility and like what your status is like patients not recognizing that your doctor and thinking. You're a nurse. I think it does happen more with men than with women or male versus female patients. I think more men identify you as a nurse than female patients, but that's really probably the only aspect that I've noticed.
Elaine
And have those. Into and have those perceptions of you being a nurse have has that affected how you? Treat like treat the patient or talk to the patient at all.
Female resident 1
Yeah, I don't think it affects me, but I think it can be a little bit shocking for the patient. It's like calling somebody by the wrong name, right. Like you're like kind of put back on your heels. You've called somebody by the wrong name. Ohh gosh. Oh, my gosh. And then you've lost your train of thought and, you know, so potentially it impairs. The patient's ability to ask the appropriate questions, they might lose their train of thought and not follow through, because even though you may politely correct them that you're the doctor, they still probably feel badly that they addressed you incorrectly.
Elaine
OK. And so moving on, are you aware of the results of this recent surgical study showing that female patients have worse short term and long term outcomes when treated by male surgeons? Yes. And what are your thoughts on the causes? Of the findings.
Female resident 1
You know, I I am aware of it, but I have not actually looked into the how the study was conducted. I find it a little bit shocking to be honest.
Elaine
Mm-hmm. Yes. And I guess based on your experiences, do you have any idea what may have led to this?
Female resident 1
Again, I just can't help but what were the percentages of? Men and women, male and female surgeons. There were predominantly more male surgeons, correct?
Elaine
I need to check but I assume so.
Female resident 1
Yeah, I think they're predominantly more male surgeons and I know the percentages even out, but it still seems like you're not exactly comparing an equal cohort. So I mean, no, it was a very well done study. It's hard for me to you know. It's hard for me to believe. To be honest.
Elaine
Yes. So male surgeon with male. It was about 500,000 and female surgeon with female patient was 92,000. And then sex discordant male surgeon with female patient with 66167 thousand and female patient with male or female surgeon with male patient was 50,000.
Female resident 1
Right. Yeah, yeah, I mean.
Elaine
No surgeons.
Female resident 1
It's hard to believe that's what it is. It's really hard To believe.
Elaine
Mm-hmm. Yes, it's a interesting finding. Do you think anything could be done to prevent this type of finding female patients having worse outcomes when treated by male surgeons?
Female resident 1
And I don't think it's like any other. I I don't think it's any different than when we talk about difference in ethnicities, you know, like race disparity in African American cardiac patients, you know, were labor and delivery and African American patients or Hispanic patients. I don't think it's any. Different than that, it's something we have to be more aware of and. Actively work to fight any bias we might have that may lead to unfavorable outcomes.
Elaine
And do you think you have received proper training to avoid this or have your coworkers received proper training?
Female resident 1
I mean, as far as gender training, we receive sexual harassment training. That's really it. We don't. And you know, as somebody who go, you know as. An hospital employee who goes through. Uh, like uh? Disparities in healthcare training, you know, we had a labor and delivery model module on how African American deaths in labor and delivery are significantly higher than Caucasian deaths. And I think just the fact that you bring awareness to it and that's not something that's out there. For, you know, gender outcomes, again, the only gender training you know, gender outcome type training we have is sexual harassment training, and that's hardly what we're talking about here.
Elaine
OK. Yeah, that makes sense. That would be helpful. And OK, so my next question is, have you noticed any differences in how female versus male surgeons practice surgery?
Female resident 1
I can say that during my. Trauma. So first of all, I have not worked at all with a female orthopedic surgeon. There isn't one in my hospital. There are some at outside hospitals who come and operate here, but I have not had the privilege of. Working with them yet. UM. When I worked on different services outside of Orthopedics, I have worked with female surgeons and male surgeons and I would say there's a little bit more. Perhaps a longer surgery, but more. Time taken, rather than sort of just getting down to it and getting the job done.
Elaine
And why did it take more time? What were they doing?
Female resident 1
Yeah, I feel like there was a little bit more of a discussion a. Pros and cons weighing the options going. You know, I'm not of a level in training that I can say that they were right or wrong or doing something. The approach was a little bit more methodical and meticulous versus we're going to all get to the same end goal that maybe somebody may have taken a little bit. Less time to sort things out and get there.
Elaine
UM, and did you notice any differences in communication during the surgery between? I guess female. Lead surgeons and male lead surgeons.
Female resident 1
At times, but I also think there's a huge personality difference in surgeons, you know, outside of the OR you might be. One way but. Inside of the ORI think there's another persona for many, and it can be very businesslike versus relaxed environment. I and I don't. I don't think I can say that I attribute. That to a gender.
Elaine
OK. Thank you. And do you think anything can be done to? Prevent male surgeons from speeding through surgeries. We're getting to the point.
Female resident 1
Yeah, I think it's just like anybody else. I think it's a personality thing. It's like a here. We're here to do a job. We're going to get it done and. We'll be we'll. See on the other side, I I don't know and I. Don't know that. It needs to be anything done about it. I think we we need. To acknowledge that there is a difference. And I think in acknowledging it and opening up that discussion, it will alleviate and and diversifying the field, it will alleviate the disparities.
Elaine
I see. OK. So you talked about the operating speed between male and female surgeons. Have you noticed any differences in the surgical technique of female versus male surgeons?
Female resident 1
Again, I'm comparing only like a handful of females to a like pool of men, so it's very. Difficult the few. Females that I have operated with are rather methodical and meticulous, and there are certainly male surgeons who are the same way, but they get diluted by the large number. And the few other surgeon male surgeons who are not as methodical and meticulous and achieve the same end goal.
Elaine
OK. UM. Do you have any thoughts on why? The females may be more methodical.
Female resident 1
I don't, I don't I. Mean. Yeah, I don't know.
Elaine
It's OK. Thank you. And have you noticed any differences in the risk taking behavior between female versus male surgeons?
Female resident 1
I do think men take more risks. OK. Yeah, I do.
Elaine
And why do you think they take more risk?
Female resident 1
Again, I I have to go back to the just sheer volume like being in male cases versus female cases that may be it, but I don't and perhaps the conversation around it, you know, if you talk about the risks and benefits and then take a risk, it's more. It it feels like less of a risk cause you acknowledged it. You discussed it and then you made a decision versus plunging in. And well, we just have to get this done. Kind of attitude that I have seen from male colleagues. My colleagues, I guess they'd be my attendings because they'd be my superiors.
Elaine
Hmm, I guess so. I had a question about that, you said mentioned that after discussing the risk and benefits and then taking a risk may feel like more less of a risk. Is that for female surgeons or is that for every surgeon?
Female resident 1
I feel that more female surgeons weigh the risks and benefits potentially out loud versus I'm and I can't speak for what goes on in somebody else's head. I can only say what is spoken out loud. So if there's more dialogue in a case with a female lead surgeon, I can only. Jump to the conclusion that the risks and benefits are being weighed because I hear them versus when I'm in a case where there's less dialogue, I don't know what the thought process on the lead surgeon is.
Elaine
OK. That makes sense. UM. Yeah. So. You talked a. Lot about how there's a much bigger volume of male surgeons versus female surgeons. And do you think having so few female surgeons affects the mentality of female surgeons and their desire to be more meticulous or methodical in how they perform?
Female resident 1
Yeah, I think just like any. Smaller group of people you know. Under a microscope. Compared to when you're in a big pond, then it's a little bit different. So I do think that there is an extra emphasis on your performance when there's only a handful of you being examined versus blending in with your surroundings.
Elaine
OK. And do you personally have this feeling also?
Female resident 1
I feel that there is more of a microscope on my performance. And my. Ability to be part of the team.
Elaine
OK. Thank you for sharing. And so I'm moving on to my last set of questions. It's regarding the training environment. And so have you noticed any differences in the training environment for female trainees versus male trainees? And what are these differences?
Female resident 1
Sure. I mean, I think that there are. I think that. There are that the male residents are more frequently requested. Some male residents, not all. I think they have a better chance of jiving with a male lead surgeon than. A female does of you know, like a relaxed OR day kind of situation. I'm not always sure that it's based on skill, but primarily personality and the comfort and ease of a team environment that day. UM. I don't think that. I don't know what goes on in other people's communication, but I. Don't. There aren't attendings reaching out to me having discussions. Nor do I always feel comfortable reaching out to male attendings. Seven, 8:00 at night to have, you know, all the discussions I want to. Whereas another. All resident may feel more comfortable, but again, I'm speculating to call up a male attending later at night. That's not something I feel awesome about in my stage of training. Perhaps that will go away as I become more senior and comfortable. But yeah, I think that's kind of. The gist.
Elaine
And to clarify. Before, when you were answering, you mentioned that the attendings might call on a male trainee when it's not as a relaxed day. Is that what you were saying?
Female resident 1
Like for instance, they, they might be more likely to call outside of the OR a male trainee to go to and assist with a football game versus a female trainee to assist to cover a football game. Whether that's a conscious thing or it's likely unconscious, you know, hey, you are a football player, you want to go to a football game. Great. Obviously, women don't even play football for the most part. It's very rare. So that's. Commonality is lacking. There's a lot of differences in my interest than my male trainee interests, and that's it leads to different. Social relationships and commonalities with the lead attending surgeon, who was also male and has different interests. So I think that plays a big role unconsciously. I would expect in how residents get requested and coverage gets determined. And those kind of things?
Elaine
OK. That makes sense.
Female resident 1
It goes the same way for like, hey, you're a Penn State fan. You know, like, whatever your college loyalty may also influence, you know, if you have a. Die hard attending. Gender may not play into it. Your commonalities are your Penn State, you know it's, it's that kind of thing. It's just you're more likely to have commonalities male to male than female to male.
Elaine
And do you think having these commonalities or differences between the trainees and the surgeons affect the quality of training that they receive?
Female resident 1
Sure. I think the more you're around, the more opportunity you have to learn. So if you're not around, you're not. In that casual or formal training environment, then you are at a disadvantage.
Elaine
OK. And in your training environment, current or previously, have you noticed any differences in the quality of training received by female versus male trainees?
Female resident 1
Hard to say because there just aren't that. Many of us. Yeah. Sorry, it's it's hard to compare.
Elaine
And what about during medical school?
Female resident 1
Yeah, sure. So I mean. Medical school, I think there's still a Bias that all of the female medical students are going to go into family medicine, OBGYN, primary care, and PEDs. And at times I'm still getting. Are you going to go into pediatric orthopedics you know? I I don't know. I think that. That does exist.
Elaine
Hmm. OK, yeah, I see. UM. And then, uh, do you think anything can be done to stop this?
Female resident 1
I mean, I think it's time I think it's just like anything else we grow the generations change and it's a time to kind of. Bring in new fresh blood and new fresh ideas.
Elaine
And are there differences in how educators of different genders teach, and if so, what are these differences?
Female resident 1
I mean, I found female surgeons to be more thorough. And male surgeons generally speaking again, I'm very much generalizing here to be a little bit less. A less thorough and less. Interested in? Longer, deeper dives into subjects, not all, but again, they dilute the the population that doesn't dilute the pool.
Elaine
OK, so my first follow-up question to that is. Amongst the male surgeons who are thorough are more thorough. Why? Why do you think these male surgeons are more thorough. Is it their personality or something else?
Female resident 1
Yeah, I feel like it's personality. It's very much personality, it's how they lead the rest of their life also.
Elaine
OK. And then in general, are female educators are more thorough in their teachings?
Female resident 1
I think it's personality, I really do. I think it's, you know, being responsible for a lot of things and I don't know, I think it's just personality, the way they developed.
Elaine
So do you think that the personality of the educated has more of an effect on the quality of teaching versus the gender?
Female resident 1
That I think that's a really good way to put it. I do think that personality has a lot. To do with it again, maybe by gender. More people have tend towards a specific personality.
Elaine
Well, could you describe what that personality is? What qualities and personality lead to more thorough teachings?
Female resident 1
Well, I think the other thing is that because the cards have been stacked against female surgeons, traditionally that the female surgeons who do make it and do exist in these environments are more thorough, aggressive, attentive because they've had to be to make it in a. Feel that? You know that they're the minority in. So I think that's the personality that you're seeing because those are the people who stuck with it and made it.
Elaine
That makes sense. And have you noticed any differences in the interactions or communications between educators and trainees of the same genders versus different genders?
Female resident 1
Sure. I think that again, it's just easier when you have more things in common to have an easier conversation rather than a. Directive, you know like this is what we're doing. You're doing this. It's it's more of a conversation when you have more things in common with the person you're speaking with.
Elaine
And my last question is, do you think the gender of the educators affects the quality of training received by female versus male trainees?
Female resident 1
Yeah, I think that, you know, if it there isn't a diverse. If there isn't diversity in the trainer, then more people are going of this of similar characteristics. Potentially, if they're more male trainers, then more male trainees will have more opportunities because of commonalities being around more often being in settings where they have the opportunity versus being in being a part. I guess in those kind of things.
Elaine
What do you think could be done to improve the quality of training received by trainees of all genders?
Female resident 1
Yeah, I mean, just like anything else, like bringing awareness, if you're aware, then you know, more likely to be conscious of your. Behaviors and then as we grow in orthopedics, I think would continue to become more diverse. We still you know I'm of a program where I know that there are a certain number of seats for orthopedic residents and I know that there are all of them are available to a man and only one is available to a female. My program's not going to take more. Than one female year. If that really so, I mean if I mean that's just. Like it's never said out loud. But we don't have a 5050 split of women and there's no way that. That we're going to become. An all female class overnight, whether and it it's, it's multifaceted, right? If we don't have female trainees, then we're less appealing to female trainees to apply. So the pool is already smaller to pick from. And then you know, I I still think that there's. That's it's just not thought of to match. A straight class of women, you know I. Don't think that's. In the near future for a lot of programs.
Elaine
Thank you so much for sharing. Do you have any last thoughts or experiences that you would like to share? I guess regarding the patient outcomes for female patients.
Female resident 1
Yeah, I think you know, you brought up a lot of very thought provoking interview, by the way. And when I think about what we just talked about and sort of when I try to dig down to the root. Of why there may be differences. I do think that historically women have been at a significant disadvantage in the surgical realm, and thus those who make it to the to be surgeons have a specific personality and a specific skill set. Therefore, I think that they are. Top of their game. You know, most persevering and attentive so. If that was one way to describe the discrepancy in patient outcomes, I think it would be reasonable and a logical jump to make when you're comparing to a more diluted pool where there might be people who are good but not great, versus the women who had to fight to get there. Who are great and may not. Be you know, you know. You know what I mean? Like, I just when I think back and. I'm like, wow, the women who made it over the last. You know, 20 years where this wasn't an acknowledge disparity and we didn't do anything about it. They were strong, strong as heck and really good. And so there's no doubt that they have excellent patient outcomes.
Elaine
Yeah. Thanks so much for sharing. That makes a lot of sense to me and that's a great way to put it. I'm going to stop recording now.
